# Abstract
Crosstalk cancellation allows for the reproduction of binaural audio through loudspeakers by using digital filters. This project aims to cover and analyze two widely implemented crosstalk cancellation systems, one that uses ridge regression and a regularization factor, and another that involves recursive cancellation using time difference analysis and head shadow coefficients. Since these methods make use of different approaches for achieving crosstalk cancellation, a section has been added to the study that conducts a spectral comparison of the two approaches.
